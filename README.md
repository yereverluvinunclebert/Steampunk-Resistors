This widget is an attractive steampunk Yahoo widget for your desktop. 
It is a simple resistor calculator. A resistor calculator displays numeric 
electrical resistance values using the colour bands on a typical electronic 
resistor when the values are entered sequentially. Functional and gorgeous at 
the same time. This Widget is a moveable widget that you can move anywhere 
around the desktop as you require.

The widget can be resized - Hover the cursor over the widget. Press the CTRL key 
and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will resize dynamically.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
provide.

your Windows desktop as long as you have the correct widget engine installed.
